### Home of BTM, the Bitronix JTA Transaction Manager ###

The Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) is a simple but complete implementation of the JTA 1.1 API. It is a fully 
working XA transaction manager that provides all services required by the JTA API while trying to keep the code 
as simple as possible for easier understanding of the XA semantics.
